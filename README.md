<p align="center"><strong>Justa</strong> is <em>just a whiteboard</em>.</p>

---

A small, local, browser-based whiteboard for explaining ideas, drawing diagrams, and thinking out loud — especially during presentations or screen shares.

No accounts.  
No internet.  
No distractions.

---

## What it does

- Freehand drawing  
- Rectangles, circles, and arrows  
- Add text at a specific point  
- Undo / clear  
- Black & white only (high contrast, presentation-friendly)

Everything runs locally in your browser.

---

## Why it exists

Sometimes you don’t want a full diagramming tool.  
You just want to draw something and explain it.

Justa is intentionally minimal and boring — so it never gets in the way of the conversation.

---

## How to use

1. Clone or download this repo  
2. Open `whiteboard.html` in your browser  
3. Start drawing  

That’s it.

---

## Design principles

- Single HTML file  
- No frameworks  
- No build step  
- Explicit state management  
- Reliable during live demos  

---

## Status

This is an early, intentionally small project.  
Features are added carefully to avoid breaking core behavior.
